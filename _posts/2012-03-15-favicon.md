For my company we have an ad-server which handles hundreds of connections per second. Many of those are HTML iframes for ads. It doesn't really make sense for those pages to have a favicon but we noticed that many browses still request favicon.ico. This only ads load to our already busy server so we place the following code in our iframe HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==">
{% endhighlight %}

This is the smalles possible image in a data url. A 1x1 gif. Even though data url's aren't support in IE versions before 9 we hardly notice any requests for favicon.ico anymore (Maybe IE doesn't request favicon's for iframes?).

Update *2012-03-17* 
-------------------

After some experimenting I found out that the following code seems to do the trick as well:

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="_">
{% endhighlight %}

We are still seeing some requests for `favicon.ico` but they seem to be mostly from older versions of Firefox (3.x.x).
