When working on a project I was wondering if all browsers would accept cookies set in http redirects. After searching for a bit I found some contradicting articles and [bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=150066) [reports](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3512) indicating that this might not always be the case. So I decided to test this in a lot of browsers and post the results online for others to find.

I wrote a small test page: [dubbelboer.com/302cookie.php](http://dubbelboer.com/302cookie.php)

What I found is that **all major browsers**, IE (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), FF (17), Safari (6.0.2), Opera (12.11) on both windows and Mac, **set cookies on redirects**. This is true for both 301 and 302 redirects. But keep in mind that 301 responses are cached much more aggressively most by browsers.

### 302cookie.php

{% highlight php %}
<?

if (isset($_GET['show'])) {
  // Delete the cookie (note: it will still be set in $_COOKIE).
  setcookie('test');

  echo 'Cookie was: ';

  if (isset($_COOKIE['test']) && ($_COOKIE['test'] == $_GET['show'])) {
    echo 'SET';
  } else {
    echo 'NOT SET';
  }

  // Make sure this is a new url. This is needed for 301 responses which are otherwise cached.
  echo '<br><a href="?a=' , microtime(true) , '">try again</a>';
} else {
  $id = microtime(true);

  setcookie('test', $id, time() + 4);
  header('Location: ?show=' . $id, true, 302); // Could also use 301.
}
{% endhighlight %}
