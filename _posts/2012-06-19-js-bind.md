A very useful javascript function that not many people seem to know is [bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)

`bind()` allows you to set the `this` variable a function is executed in. When using a more object oriented approach this can be very useful.

Another thing you can do with `bind()` is pre assign some of the arguments provided to the function. This can be used to pass additional arguments to your event handlers.

See this simple example:

{% highlight js %}
var http = require('http');

function handleRequest(data, req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('data: ' + data);
}

http.createServer(handleRequest.bind(this, '1337'     )).listen(8081);
http.createServer(handleRequest.bind(this, 'something')).listen(8082);
{% endhighlight %}
